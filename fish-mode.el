;;; Commentary:

;; A very basic version of major mode for fish shell scripts.
;; Current features:
;;
;;  - keyword highlight
;;  - basic indent
;;  - comment detection
;;  - run fish_indent for indention
;;
;;  To run fish_indent before save, add the following to init script:
;;  (add-hook 'fish-mode-hook (lambda ()
;;                              (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'fish_indent-before-save)))
